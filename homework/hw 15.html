            <h3>Knitting</h3>
            <p>Knitting is truly such a relaxing and innocent hobby—
                it's meditation but with added cozy feelings and homemade treats at the end. 
                The repetition is extremely calming, so it's perfect for stress management,
                 and it even improves your attention, memory, and even elementary math skills because of all the math and pattern-following. 
                 It’s also a super creative outlet—you can play with colors, textures, and designs to make things like scarves, sweaters, or even plushies, basically turning yarn into wearable art.
                  In all, it's an easy-to-learn, stress-free, and somewhat legendary hobby.

            <h3>Crochet</h3>
            <p>Crocheting is a form of needle craft where yarn is transformed into textured fabric by using a hooked needle. 
                Crocheting also involves a process where stitches are made by using the crochet hook to loop and pull yarn through the loop. Crochet can be done with just one hook and any type of yarn and has many different uses.
                 It’s one of the easiest crafts to learn and is great for beginners.
